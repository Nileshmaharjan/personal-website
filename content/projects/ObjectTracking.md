This project focuses on real-time object tracking in videos using a combination of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for initial object detection and DeepSort (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for tracking objects over consecutive frames. The goal is to provide accurate and efficient tracking of objects in videos, enhancing the perceptibility of moving objects.
